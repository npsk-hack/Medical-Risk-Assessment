In the case of heart surgeries (CABG – Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting), a major part of the whole ordeal consists of deciding whether the patient is fit enough to be taken into surgery or not.They receive preliminary data about the patient but cannot take into account all of the risk factors before making a decision. Instead, we can consider major factors, to decide whether the patient can be operated on.
But, with so many other factors in today’s world, this is not enough. The patient could have a dormant diseases which aren’t taken into account by doctors alone. Few factors could be borderline but overlooked and hence could lead to complications during the surgery.  Various problems ignored by doctors due to ignorance or oversight need to be taken into account.
This error can be removed or at least minimised with the help of a scoring system.
With a program to read all of the data about a patient and through previously fed data and outcomes, the system can decide whether or not the patient can be accepted into surgery, if the patient can be treated with medication or if there is little to nothing the doctors can do for him/her.
This prediction system would be very beneficial to doctors in all fields, not only cardiac surgery.
